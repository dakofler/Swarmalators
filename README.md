# Impact on Convergence Time of Swarmalators by using Momentum

This simulation was created based on the paper 'Swarmalators with Stochastic Coupling and Memory' by Udo Schilcher, Jorge F. Schmidt, Arke Vogell, and Christian Bettstetter<br>

The model is extended by adding a momentum term to analyze whether this accelerates convergence.
